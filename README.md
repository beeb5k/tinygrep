## What is tinygrep

A small, minimal version of `grep`/`ripgrep` that's the idea, at least.
The goal is to build it with zero external dependencies, keeping everything simple and self-contained.

### Me tweaking
I don't know how to benchmark this yet, but damn it's already really fast.
Even though it's still pretty basic, and I haven’t added any custom algorithms, performance tweaks, or parallelism, the speed is honestly impressive.

## Future Plans
I'm currently learning Rust, and as I progress, I’ll keep improving this project.
Some things I plan to add:
- Parallelism
- More CLI options
- Performance optimizations (if needed)
